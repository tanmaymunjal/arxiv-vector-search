What is quantum physics?,"  The new emerging quantum physics - quantum computing conceptual bridge,
mandates a ``grand unification'' of space-time-matter and quantum information
(all quantized), with deep implications for science in general. The major
physics revolutions in our understanding of the universe are briefly reviewed
and a ``missing'' equivalence principle is identified and its nature explained.
An implementation as an external super-symmetry $\C{E}=ic\C{P}$ is suggested,
generalizing the Wick rotation ``trick''. Taking advantage of the
interpretation of entropy as a measure of symmetry, it is naturally asimilated
within the present Feynman Path Integral algebraic formalism.

What are the psychological effects of mobile phones?,"  When will the Internet become aware of itself? In this note the problem is
approached by asking an alternative question: Can the Internet cope with
stress? By extrapolating the psychological difference between coping and
defense mechanisms a distributed software experiment is outlined which could
reject the hypothesis that the Internet is not a conscious entity.

Is life fair?,"  Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny. This
ubiquitous trait seems to increase motivation and persistence, and is probably
evolutionarily adaptive. But how good really is our ability to control? How
successful is our track record in these areas? There is little understanding of
when and under what circumstances we may over-estimate or even lose our ability
to control and optimize outcomes, especially when they are the result of
aggregations of individual optimization processes. Here, we demonstrate
analytically using the theory of Markov Chains and by numerical simulations in
two classes of games, the Minority game and the Parrondo Games, that agents who
optimize their strategy based on past information actually perform worse than
non-optimizing agents. In other words, low-entropy (more informative)
strategies under-perform high-entropy (or random) strategies. This provides a
precise definition of the ""illusion of control"" in set-ups a priori defined to
emphasize the importance of optimization.

The merits of spirituality,"  We present a qualitative study of 20 American Orthodox Jewish families' use
of home automation for religious purposes. These lead users offer insight into
real-life, long-term experience with home automation technologies. We discuss
how automation was seen by participants to contribute to spiritual experience
and how participants oriented to the use of automation as a religious custom.
We also discuss the relationship of home automation to family life. We draw
design implications for the broader population, including surrender of control
as a design resource, home technologies that support long-term goals and
lifestyle choices, and respite from technology.
