What is quantum physics?,"The degree by which a function can be differentiated need not be restricted
to integer values. Usually most of the field equations of physics are taken to
be second order, curiosity asks what happens if this is only approximately the
case and the field equations are nearly second order. For Robertson-Walker
cosmology there is a simple fractional modification of the Friedman and
conservation equations. In general fractional gravitational equations similar
to Einstein's are hard to define as this requires fractional derivative
geometry. What fractional derivative geometry might entail is briefly looked at
and it turns out that even asking very simple questions in two dimensions leads
to ambiguous or intractable results. A two dimensional line element which
depends on the Gamma-function is looked at.",['None'],What is quantum physics?,0.0,0.8007538678386092
What are the psychological effects of mobile phones?,"Controllable story generation is a challenging task in the field of NLP,
which has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, most
existing works generate a whole story conditioned on the appointed keywords or
emotions, ignoring the psychological changes of the protagonist. Inspired by
psychology theories, we introduce global psychological state chains, which
include the needs and emotions of the protagonists, to help a story generation
system create more controllable and well-planned stories. In this paper, we
propose a Psychology-guIded Controllable Story Generation System (PICS) to
generate stories that adhere to the given leading context and desired
psychological state chains for the protagonist. Specifically, psychological
state trackers are employed to memorize the protagonist's local psychological
states to capture their inner temporal relationships. In addition,
psychological state planners are adopted to gain the protagonist's global
psychological states for story planning. Eventually, a psychology controller is
designed to integrate the local and global psychological states into the story
context representation for composing psychology-guided stories. Automatic and
manual evaluations demonstrate that PICS outperforms baselines, and each part
of PICS shows effectiveness for writing stories with more consistent
psychological changes.",['None'],What are the psychological effects of mobile phones?,0.7700240921035056,0.7530543073708604
Is life fair?,"Training ML models which are fair across different demographic groups is of
critical importance due to the increased integration of ML in crucial
decision-making scenarios such as healthcare and recruitment. Federated
learning has been viewed as a promising solution for collaboratively training
machine learning models among multiple parties while maintaining the privacy of
their local data. However, federated learning also poses new challenges in
mitigating the potential bias against certain populations (e.g., demographic
groups), as this typically requires centralized access to the sensitive
information (e.g., race, gender) of each datapoint. Motivated by the importance
and challenges of group fairness in federated learning, in this work, we
propose FairFed, a novel algorithm for fairness-aware aggregation to enhance
group fairness in federated learning. Our proposed approach is server-side and
agnostic to the applied local debiasing thus allowing for flexible use of
different local debiasing methods across clients. We evaluate FairFed
empirically versus common baselines for fair ML and federated learning, and
demonstrate that it provides fairer models particularly under highly
heterogeneous data distributions across clients. We also demonstrate the
benefits of FairFed in scenarios involving naturally distributed real-life data
collected from different geographical locations or departments within an
organization.",['None'],Is life fair?,0.77740231349606,0.7463758832474772
What is madness?,"Our collective views regarding the question ""what is fundamental?"" are
continually evolving. These ontological shifts in what we regard as fundamental
are largely driven by theoretical advances (""what can we calculate?""), and
experimental advances (""what can we measure?""). Rarely (in my view) is
epistemology the fundamental driver; more commonly epistemology reacts (after a
few decades) to what is going on in the theoretical and experimental zeitgeist.",['None'],What is madness?,0.0,0.7239035537553224
The merits of spirituality,"In today's rapidly evolving workplace, the dynamics of job satisfaction and
its determinants have become a focal point of organizational studies. This
research offers a comprehensive examination of the nexus between spiritual
intelligence and job satisfaction among female employees, with particular
emphasis on the moderating role of ethical work environments. Beginning with an
exploration of the multifaceted nature of human needs, the study delves deep
into the psychological underpinnings that drive job satisfaction. It elucidates
how various tangible and intangible motivators, such as salary benefits and
recognition, play pivotal roles in shaping employee attitudes and behaviors.
Moreover, the research spotlights the unique challenges and experiences of
female employees, advocating for a more inclusive understanding of their needs.
An extensive review of the literature and empirical analysis culminates in the
pivotal finding that integrating spiritual intelligence and ethical
considerations within organizational practices can significantly enhance job
satisfaction. Such a holistic approach, the paper posits, not only bolsters the
well-being and contentment of female employees but also augments overall
organizational productivity, retention rates, and morale.",['None'],The merits of spirituality,0.7628877509262205,0.8455273515493047
